### 7. What did you learn in your Full Stack School's program?

The cyber bootcamp offered a comprehensive education in offensive and defensive cybersecurity strategies. On the offensive side, participants learned Red Team skills, including identifying and exploiting web vulnerabilities, executing social engineering attacks, and using tools like Metasploit for exploitation and credential collection. They also learned privilege escalation and lateral movement techniques, gaining a deep understanding of attackers' methods.

On the defensive side, Blue Team training is designed to empower participants by focusing on strengthening systems against attacks. They learn to parse logs effectively, create Splunk visualizations, and conduct digital forensics to investigate and mitigate security incidents. This comprehensive approach equips them with the skills to identify, protect, detect, respond to, and recover from cyber threats, ensuring a solid defensive posture and instilling confidence in their abilities.

In addition to Red and Blue Team training, the bootcamp emphasizes the versatility of Python programming for automating tasks, parsing logs, and analyzing data, enhancing overall cybersecurity proficiency. This emphasis on Python not only enhances their technical skills but also makes them adaptable and resourceful in the face of evolving cybersecurity challenges. The bootcamp also hones system administration skills with a focus on managing files, permissions, and applications in both Windows and Linux environments.

Overall, the bootcamp's curriculum provided a balanced and rigorous education, equipping participants with the knowledge and skills to address real-world cybersecurity challenges from offensive and defensive perspectives effectively.


### 8. Walk me through one of your projects that you are most proud of. (Web Development 1/2)

One of the projects I'm particularly proud of is the Database Tool, which I developed during Phase 3 of my Flatiron School program.

The reason I built this app is intensely personal; I wanted to create an educational app for my children. Database Tool allows users to study US entities, including a fun and engaging game to test their knowledge.

Database Tool is a command line interface (CLI) built using PYTHON tools like SQLALCHEMY, SQLITE3, and CLICK. Its primary purpose is to manage US entities such as states, cities, and counties, focusing on making CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations intuitive and user-friendly.

One unique aspect of Database Tool is that it comes with a game that challenges users to guess the capitals of the US states.

In the future, I plan to expand the scope of Database Tool by adding new topics such as math, science, and history. Additionally, I have plans to translate the app into Spanish, making it accessible to a broader audience.

### 11. Tell me about a time when you successfully solved a problem/resolved a difficult situation and how you did that.

**Situation**: When I started in a previous role, my manager asked me to do a simple administrative task. I’d completed this type of work many times before, so I thought I knew what to do.

**Task**: However, I listened only partially to his brief and missed an essential part of the task. I failed because I hadn’t completed everything as per his instructions.

**Action**: As soon I realized this, I apologized unreservedly and took action to make things right. I then decided to make changes to how I worked. I wrote down all the instructions, confirmed them with my manager, and double-checked everything.

**Result**: I always succeeded because of my new systematic approach to working.
