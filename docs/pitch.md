### Transcript

I'm Ivan Arias; I recently graduated with a certification in Web development. I'm passionate about mastering front-end and back-end development. I have a geological background and strong interpersonal and team-building skills.

I am a completer-finisher who can be relied upon to complete a job on time and to an excellent standard. I am reliable, flexible, adaptable, and will carry out tasks outside the job description. I have a track record of achievement. I achieved excellent grades and am often praised for my work speed and how I would get more job done than the average person.

Also, I'm excited to apply my skills and continue learning in a professional setting.
